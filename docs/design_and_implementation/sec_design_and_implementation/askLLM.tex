\subsection{AskLLM}
AskLLM is a LLM chatting interface to speed up user's development progress.
\subsubsection{Models}
Currently, we provide the Apple Intelligence model, which comes with the latest
Apple OS (iOS 26 / iPadOS 26 / macOS 26). 
\begin{itemize}%[leftmargin=*]
    \item Benefits:
    \begin{itemize}%[leftmargin=*]
        \item Local inference provides privacy and unlimited query quota
        \item Offers offline availability
    \end{itemize}
    \item Drawbacks:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Low quality response due to small model size on local devices
        \item Not available on older devices
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
We only provide a single model due to development time and budget constraint. Since this is not a
technical difficulty, we can simply include more APIs to offer more choices
to users in the future.
