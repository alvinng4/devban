\subsection{Database}
For database, we chose the Firebase Firestore service, which is a
flexible and scalable NoSQL database.
It offers multi-platform support, which allows us to expand our supported platforms in the future.
Furthermore, it provides a generous free plan for development and testing purpose.

The details about the data will be discussed in subsequent sections.
