\section{Design And Implementation}
\subsection{Database}

\subsection{User Authentication}
For reliable user authentication, we adopted the external Firebase Authentication service. 

\subsubsection{Sign up methods}
We provide the following two methods for user sign up as these are the most common methods:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Email
    \item Google sign in
\end{enumerate}
User should provide the following information:
\begin{itemize}%[leftmargin=*]
    \item Username
    \item Email
    \item Password
\end{itemize}
For email sign up, user must pass the email verification to sign in their account to prevent
abuse.

\subsubsection{Sequence diagram}
Figure \ref{fig:user_auth_sequence} shows the workflow for user authentication.
Note that the database (Firebase Firestore) is not involved in this process.
Firebase Auth will automatically store the user credentials and their username.

\subsubsection{UI design}
Figure \ref{fig:ui_design_auth} shows the UI design for login and sign up.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Deleting User Account}
To protect user privacy, when user initiates account deletion, all of their
account-related data will be deleted.

\subsection{Teams Management}
In order to work together, users must first create a team on devban.

\subsubsection{License}
A license key is required for creating a team. User can contact us via email
and subscribe to our plans to get a license key. A license key will then be
manually created by us and stored on the database.

A license key on the database should contain the following data:
\begin{itemize}%[leftmargin=*]
    \item \texttt{id} (String): the license key
    \item \texttt{description} (String): Description containing necessary information.
    \item \texttt{team\_id} (String): ID of the team that was created by the license key.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Sequence diagram}
Figure \ref{fig:team_sequence} shows the workflow for creating and joining a team.
