\subsection{User Authentication}
For reliable user authentication, we cooperates with the external Firebase Authentication service. 

\subsubsection{Sign up methods}
We provide the following two methods for user sign up as these are the most common methods:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Email
    \item Google sign in
\end{enumerate}
For email sign up, user must pass the email verification to sign in their account.

\subsubsection{Sequence diagram}
Figure \ref{fig:user_auth_sequence} shows the workflow for user authentication.

\subsubsection{Deleting User Account}
To protect user privacy, when user initiates account deletion, all of their
account-related data will be deleted.

\subsection{Teams Management}
In order to work together, users must first create a team on devban.

\subsubsection{License}
A license key is required for creating a team. User can contact us via email
and subscribe to our plans to get a license key. A license key will then be
manually created by us and stored on the database.

Figure \ref{fig:team_sequence} shows the workflow for creating and joining a team.
