\section{Human Interface Design}
For our application, the Neobrutalism UI style is adopted. The benefits are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item High contrast emphasizing the main contents
    \item Block-like layout simplify UI design for multiple components on the same view
    \item Provides an unique, memorable user interface
    \item Comes with interactive elements with animations
\end{enumerate}
Some of the layout designs are reused and improved based on the QuestList application [\ref{ref:QuestList}].
We also provide the following features to enhance the UX:
(1) Multiple themes (blue, green and orange);
(2) Optional sound and haptic feedbacks;
(3) Dark mode (auto, light or dark).
